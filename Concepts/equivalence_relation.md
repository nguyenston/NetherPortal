> [!tip] Takeaway
> An equivalence is a notion that two objects are the same (in some aspect). 

A binary relation $\sim$ on a set $\mathcal{X}$ is an equivalence relation if it satisfies the following properties:
* Reflexivity: $x\sim x\ \forall x\in\mathcal{X}$
* Symmetry: $x\sim y \iff y\sim x\ \forall x,y\in\mathcal{X}$
* Transitivity: $x\sim y\ \wedge\ y\sim z\implies x\sim z\ \forall x,y,z\in\mathcal{X}$
