A space $\mathcal{X}$ is separable if it contains a [[Countable set| countable]], [[Dense subset|dense]] subset. 

> [!tip] Practicality
> * One can approximate elements of a set arbitrarily well using elements of a dense subset.
> * Countable sets are nicer and easier to work with than uncountable ones.
> * When working with a separable space, many useful properties can be proved on a countable, dense subset and then have these properties transfer over to the whole space via some kind of approximation arguments.

# Examples

## The space of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$

The space of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is a countable, dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
